Thanks for your interest in joining the Network Dynamics Lab!  As part of the interview process,
we ask each applicant to conduct a small data analysis project.  Our goal here is to understand
more about how you approach research and your familiarity with various techniques and tools.
That said, we hope this exercise will also be fun!

# Task Description
Your goal is to perform a classification task on Jeopardy questions (and answers)
and share some interesting insight that comes out of it.  The dataset of questions
was first [announced on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/).
For convenience, we have included it in this Github repository.

Maybe you build a classifier for question categories or answers mentioning world leaders.  The specific
classification task you undertake is totally up to you.  What we want to see is:

  - a machine learning system (doesn't have to be fancy)
  - an analysis of classifier performance
  - a critical analysis of what the classifier or its output tells us about the underlying classes you were studying

In terms of deliverables, please submit the following by email to [Derek](mailto:derek.ruths@mcgill.ca).

  - all your source code
  - a Makefile that will run your analysis from start to finish (you may assume that
    the jeopardy data file, `JEOPARDY_QUESTIONS.json` is located in the directory
    right above your submission directory)
  - A short (less than 1 page) discussion that (1) analyzes your classifier performance and
    (2) reveals something new and interesting about the underlying classes you were studying

**Final note:** Your submission will be treated with complete confidentiality - it will not ever
be shared with anyone beyond Derek and the NDL PhD students.  That said, please
do not submit any confidential or sensitive information.

**Final, final note:** While we hope you will take the project seriously, please don't
spend too much time on it. If your analysis is taking more than 3 or 4 hours, that's either
a sign that you're being a bit too ambitious or that you need to spend more time building your core
skillset (in which case, we'll look forward to your application in future years).
